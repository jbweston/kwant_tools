Kwant Tools
===========

A small set of utilities for use with the [Kwant](http://kwant-project.org/)
package for quantum transport simulations.

Kwant is a very general and powerful library. Part of its design philosophy
is to keep it reasonably lean so as not to burden the user with
a load of functionality that they don't need. In this way it is a framework
in which to implement quantum transport simulations, rather than a
plug-and-play simulation package. The downside of this design philosophy
is that there are often common idioms that have to be implemented and
re-implemented by the users themselves, because the concepts are not
sufficiently general to be included in Kwant.

`kwant_tools` aims to be a central place where small recipes and common
functionality can be made available to the whole Kwant community.
The idea is that people will contribute recipes that they find themselves
using and re-using so that everyone can benefit from their work.
